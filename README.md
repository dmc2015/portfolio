<h1>About Me</h1>

<h1>Don McLamb</h1>
<p>
Hey, thanks for stopping by to visit my site.
</p>

<p>
I am a recent graduate of General Assembly's WDI program at their
Washington D.C location. Prior to entering the WDI program I worked
in software support for three years and during that time I received
my Masters in CyberSecurity from UMUC December of 2014.

I am passionate about learning new technologies, start ups, building secure apps and apps that can create a more secure web.
<p>

<p><h2>Why I made <h1>Cyberdesigns.io</h1> ?</h2></p>

Cyberdesigns.io was created so that I could continue to develop
and grow my skills as a full-stack web developer through freelance and short-term project work. I have worked in the typical office setting
for sometime now and I am looking to try something different

I intend to continue to develop my portfolio and display my work here
so be sure to check back later and <p id=follow> follow</p> for additional updates.
